# Metaverse_proj
-> This project aims to make the use of blockchain and the VR domain in order to make the initial stage for the Metaverse world buildup.

### Tech Stacks Used :
* Threejs - for the making of staging area and the creation of various objects that can be viewed in VR from the threejs library. You can even change the camera angle to view the conplete Metaverse world or environment.
* RemixIDE - for the creation of smart contract logic and deployment of the contract.
* Solidity language - Code for smart contract to be run by EVM.
* Bootstrap - For the minimal framework for the frontend and the form that collects the data from the user and sends it to smart contract for NFT to be minted.


**These objects will be created in the form of NFT, as when they will be created, their transcation will be minted on the blockchain, and will be permanently stored with the user or the person who has minted that NFT. Each individual 
user will be having its own separate NFT that will be saved in his account as he has minted that NFT.**
